### Check out some of my _public projects_

Remember:
1. Someone else may work on the listed projects after me, and sometimes things can break.
2. The landing pages may be removed because the marketing campaign may have ended.

I try to keep this list updated with links to functioning websites, but I may be too busy to regularly check them.
